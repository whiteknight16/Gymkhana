This JavaScript code defines a function connectDb that connects to a MongoDB database using the Mongoose library.

connectDb: This function takes a url as a parameter, which is the connection string of the MongoDB database. It uses the mongoose.connect method to establish a connection to the database. The options useNewUrlParser and useUnifiedTopology are set to true for the connection.
The function is then exported for use in other parts of the application.
