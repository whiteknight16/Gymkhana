This is a React component named Discover.

It imports four other components: Header, Footer, BlogCard, and BlogCardLoged.
The Discover component renders a div that contains the Header with the text "DISCOVER", either the BlogCardLoged or BlogCard component depending on the current path, and the Footer component.
If the current path is '/discoverlog', it renders BlogCardLoged. Otherwise, it renders BlogCard.
The purpose of this component is to structure and display these components on the page. The actual functionality would be within the Header, Footer, BlogCard, and BlogCardLoged components themselves.
