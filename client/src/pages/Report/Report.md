This is a React component named Report.

It imports four other components: Header, Footer, Stats, and Graph.
The Report component renders a div that contains the Header with the text "REPORT", the Stats component with a className of "stats", the Graph component, and the Footer component.
The purpose of this component is to structure and display these four components on the page. The actual functionality would be within the Header, Footer, Stats, and Graph components themselves.
