This is a React component named Custom.

It imports three other components: CustomRoutine, Header, and Footer.
The Custom component renders a div that contains the Header with the text "SELECT CUSTOM EXERCISES", the CustomRoutine component, and the Footer component.
The purpose of this component is to structure and display these three components on the page. The actual functionality would be within the CustomRoutine, Header, and Footer components themselves.
