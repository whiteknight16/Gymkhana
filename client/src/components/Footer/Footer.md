This is a part of a React component that renders a div with the class footer-item. Inside this div, there are two child elements:

FontAwesomeIcon: This is a component from the @fortawesome/react-fontawesome library that displays an icon. The icon prop is set to faStopwatch, which means it will display a stopwatch icon.

p: This is a standard HTML paragraph element that displays the text "Training".

This code is likely part of a footer navigation menu, where each footer-item represents a different section of the website or application. When clicked, it would typically navigate the user to the corresponding section.
