This is a React functional component named ExerciseCard. It takes four props: image, text, level, and link.

The useNavigate hook from react-router-dom is used to get the navigate function, which can be used to programmatically navigate to different routes.

The component returns a div element with a CSS class of exerciseCard. The style prop is used to set the background image of the div to the image prop. The onClick prop is set to a function that calls navigate(link), so when the div is clicked, it will navigate to the route specified by the link prop.

Inside the div, there's another div that contains an h3 element displaying the text prop, a p element with some placeholder text, and another div with the class level. This div displays one to three FontAwesomeIcon components depending on the level prop.
