This code is part of a React component that functions as a timer.
This component is used to handle stopwatch
When the stop watch is stopped session count is increased by 1 and time is increased by time one exercised
It uses useState to create a time object and a running boolean. The time object tracks the minutes and seconds, and running indicates whether the timer is active.
A useEffect hook is used to start an interval that increments the sec property of time every second when running is true. If running is false, it clears the interval.
The start function sets running to true, starting the timer.
The stop function sets running to false, stopping the timer. It then updates a storedTime object (a copy of time) by adding the current time values to it. If storedTime.sec is 60 or more, it increments storedTime.min by the quotient of storedTime.sec divided by 60 and sets storedTime.sec to the remainder.
