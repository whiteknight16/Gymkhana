This is a React component named LoginComponent.

It uses useState to create state variables for username, password, and errorMessage.
The handleLogin function is an asynchronous function that is triggered when the login button is clicked. It sends a POST request to an API endpoint to attempt to log in with the username and password. If the request is successful, it stores the returned token in local storage and navigates to the '/discoverlog' route. If there's an error during the request, it sets errorMessage to 'Wrong credentials entered'.
The return statement renders a form with inputs for the username and password, a login button that triggers handleLogin when clicked, and an error message if errorMessage is not empty.
