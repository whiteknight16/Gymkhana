It is used to render custom styles

This is a React functional component named CustomExercisesComponent. It renders a list of custom exercises and a button to add more exercises.

The useState hook is used to initialize the data state with the custom exercises stored in local storage. If there's no data in local storage, it initializes data with an empty array.

In the returned JSX, it maps over the data array and creates an ExerciseEle component for each exercise. The key prop is set to the index of the exercise, and the name, gif, and reps props are set to the corresponding elements of the current exercise array.

After the list of exercises, it renders a Link that navigates to the /customAdd route when clicked. This Link wraps a button with the class customExerciseButton and the text "+", which is used to add more exercises.

The CustomExercisesComponent function is then exported for use in other parts of the application
