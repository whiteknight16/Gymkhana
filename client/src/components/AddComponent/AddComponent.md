This is a React component named AddComponent.

It uses useState to create state variables for title, image, content, and error.
The handleSubmit function is an asynchronous function that is triggered when the form is submitted. It prevents the default form submission, checks if all fields are filled, and if they are, it sends a POST request to an API endpoint to create a new blog post with the title, image, and content. If the request is successful, it navigates to the '/discoverlog' route. If there's an error during the request, it logs the error to the console.
The return statement (which is not fully included in the provided code) presumably returns the JSX to render the form.
