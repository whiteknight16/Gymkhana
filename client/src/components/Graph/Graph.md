This is a part of a React component that manages weight data and renders a line graph.

The handleAddData function is used to add new weight data to the weightData state and store it in the local storage. The new weight data is taken from the newWeight state, which is bound to an input field.

The useEffect hook is used to load the initial weight data from local storage when the component mounts. If there's no data in local storage, it initializes weightData with an empty array.

The rendered JSX includes a form for entering the current weight and a button for adding the data. The onChange handler of the input field updates the newWeight state whenever the input value changes. The onClick handler of the button calls handleAddData to add the current weight data.

Finally, a Chart component is rendered to display the weight data as a line graph. The chartType prop is set to "LineChart", and the width and height props are used to set the size of the chart.
