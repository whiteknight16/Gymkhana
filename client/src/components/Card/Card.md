This is a React functional component named Card. It takes three props: children, image, and message.

The useState hook is used to create a state variable days with an initial value of 0.

The component returns a div element with a CSS class of card. The style prop is used to set the background image of the div to the image prop.

Inside the div, there's an h3 element that displays the children prop, a conditional rendering that displays a p element with the message prop if days is 0 and an h2 element with the days value otherwise, and a button element with the text "Start".

The Card component is then exported for use in other parts of the application.
