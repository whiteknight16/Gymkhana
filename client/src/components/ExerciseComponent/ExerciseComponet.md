This code is part of a React component that renders different sets of exercises based on the current URL path.

If the path is /absinter, it renders a header "ABS INTERMEDIATE" and maps over the data array to display exercises that are either for all targets or specifically for 'abs' with a level of 1 or higher.
If the path is /chestbeginner, it renders a header "CHEST BEGINNER" and maps over the data array to display exercises that are either for all targets or specifically for 'chest' with a level of 1.
If the path is /chestinter, it renders a header "CHEST INTERMEDIATE" and maps over the data array to display exercises that are either for all targets or specifically for 'chest' with a level of 1 or higher.
In each case, it uses the ExerciseEle component to display each exercise, passing the video, name, reps, gif, and cal properties as props. It also includes a Footer component at the end.
