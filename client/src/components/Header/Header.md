This is a simple React functional component named Header. It takes one prop, children, which represents any child elements passed between the opening and closing tags of the Header component.

The component returns a div element that contains an h1 element. The h1 element has a CSS class named header and displays the children prop.

The Header component is then exported for use in other parts of the application.
